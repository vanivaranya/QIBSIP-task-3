CAR PRICE PREDICTION WITH MACHINE LEARNING

The price of a car depends on a lot of factors like the goodwill of the brand of the car, features of the car, horsepower and the mileage it gives and many more. Car price prediction is one of the major research areas in machine learning. So in this project I trained a car price prediction model.

I performed EDA on the dataset and then trained models- Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor on the dataset, Random Forest Regressor having higher accuracy of 96%.
